Description: JSAR (Job Safety Analysis in R) is a package whose goal is to create tools for 
occupational risk prevention. Thousand of accidents occur daily in workplaces 
around the world. Analyzing them is basic to prevent them for next times. 
These analyses are usually made in Excel or with online tools that different
governments provide for their citizens; however, I think that R could be the perfect
environment to do this kind of analysis.
